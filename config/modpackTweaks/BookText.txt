**This is the file that ModpackTweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
to make this text file easier to read.
These lines don't have line breaks between them
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line

**Begin book text after asterisks**

Hello and welcome to DNP - Das Neu Packen.
**~~~
**Should you want to read the latest changes in-game all you need to do is use the command "/dnp changelog" to recieve a book. The book will always display the latest changes, there is no need to request another one with every update.
~~~
A list of changes and tweaks can be found in the modpack's github repository. You can reach it by clicking the button "About DNP" in the main menu.~
~
As always, NEI is the best possible companion for any modded experience.
~~~
This modpack is still in development. It's a one man task and there are so many different mods and interactions between them.~
~
Mods can be added and removed at any time and older worlds can be incompatible with newer versions.
~~~
Don't hesitate in giving me your feedback regarding all the changes and mods it includes.~
~
However, please note that this modpack is highly based in my personal experience and enjoyment, which can be very different from your own taste. 
~~~
Thank you for trying DNP, hopefully you can enjoy it as much I do.~
~
Have fun.~
