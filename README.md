What makes this pack different?
======
Every mod is handpicked after thorough consideration and its configurations edited to their best with both the harmony of the pack and player experience in mind. The pack does the tweaks so you don't have to.

Features include, but are not limited to:
* Tweaked IguanaTinkerTweaks configs for a longer TCon tool experience (_fibbonaci_-like tool leveling)
* Custom ore spawning algorithm (mine depth follows your progress through the tool tiers)
* Added recipes for the player's convenience (clay decrafting, etc)
* Player-nagging free configs (no update warnings )
* Custom main menu
