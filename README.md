# _Das Neu Packen_ - a carefully crafted modded Minecraft modpack

## Mods included: ###
You can find the current list, which is generated automatically [here](https://github.com/WesternFreak/Das-Neu-Packen/blob/master/Mod-List.txt).

This list is NOT final: mods can be added if interesting enough, mods can be removed if they break or if permission issues arise.

## What makes this pack different? ###
Every mod is handpicked after thorough consideration and its configurations edited to their best with both the harmony of the pack and player experience in mind. The pack does the tweaks so you don't have to.

Features include, but are not limited to:
* Tweaked IguanaTinkerTweaks configs for a longer TCon tool experience
* Custom ore spawning algorithms (required mining depth follows your progress through the tool tiers)
* Quality of life recipes for the player's convenience (clay decrafting, etc)
* Player-nagging free configs (no update warnings)
* NEI culling (removing duplicated/technical/useless entries) for faster recipe lookups
* A custom main menu

You can find all the changes [here](https://github.com/WesternFreak/Das-Neu-Packen/blob/master/CHANGES.md).
